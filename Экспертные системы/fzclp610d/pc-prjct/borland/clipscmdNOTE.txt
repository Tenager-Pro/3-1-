To create the commandline version I had to do a few things:

1. removed all of the edxxxx.c files from the build

2. in setup.h set windows_interface to 0
              set emacs_editor to 0

3. modified sysdep.c to removed various references to
		setvect
		getvect
		interrupt (this appears to be a keyword)
		biostime

4. In the Borland project I set the Target Model to Console rather than GUI!
   (to access this right click on the clipscmd[.exe] in the project window
    and select Target Expert...


   with IBM_TBC flag set (Borland compiler).
   These things only appear to be useable in a 16-bit environment.
   Should probably look for a way to add them back in but they are not crucial.
